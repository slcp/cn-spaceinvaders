# Space Invaders - Classic Yet Contemporary

## Project Description
This my version of Space Invaders written in browser compatible ES6 JavaScript. The game play will be familiar to anyone who has played Space Invaders anywhere else though it is more inspired by Space Invaders than a carbon copy.

This is a constant and slowly evolving project that I just do because I enjoy it.

## Motivations
I started this project as a bit of something new to learn on the side, it has grown and stuck with me.

## Install and Play
  - `git clone`
  - `yarn|npm install`
  - `yarn|npm start`
  
## Play
#### Controls
  - Strafing - `left/right` arrow keys
  - Shooting - `spacebar` press or hold
