# Space Invaders - Classic Yet Contemporary

## Project Description
This my version of Space Invaders written in browser compatible ES6 JavaScript using Class syntax and for the most part the stricter typed struture of non-JavaScript OOP. The game play will be familiar to anyone who has played Space Invaders anywhere else though it is more inspired by Space Invaders than a carbon copy.

## Motivations
I started this project as both a lerning tool and a deomnstration of my skills. Whilst this must be taken on faith I have written this blind without looking at any of the many tutorials that out there. 

## Installation
If you want to play this clone the repository and open index.html in your browser.

## Credits
